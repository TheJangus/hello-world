            <p>I have     Hiking is one of my favorite hobbies. I love spending as much time as I can outdoors. Being out in nature with fresh air and the sounds of wildlife give me a sense of calmness I do not get in the city. I also enjoy backpacking and camping as well. These are all great outdoor activities. It can get even better considering you can backpack and hike out to go camping. Once you set up camp you can go hiking around camp too.
